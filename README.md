This project considers intelligent agents' behaviours in the frozen lake game environment obtained from Open AI Gym. The aim is to investigate the strategy in the way the agent manoeuvres across the frozen fields. The agents' actions are controlled by reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-learning, Iterative Policy, and the Monte Carlo algorithm. This study studies which algorithm is the most capable in manoeuvring across the virtual environment by evaluating its performance in terms of rewards obtained by the agent reaching its goal state whilst assessing its performance against several scenarios such as the number of episodes, the grid size of the environment and the surface of the frozen field also to observe how the algorithms strategies operate in a more complex environment.
